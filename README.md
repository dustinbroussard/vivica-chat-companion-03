# Vivica: Your Local AI Chat Companion

**Vivica** is a privacy-first, AI-powered chat assistant built for real personality, deep memory, and full user control—all running locally as a PWA. She’s more than just another chatbot: Vivica remembers, adapts, and reacts in ways no other assistant does.


## Features

- **True Local-First Design:**  
  All chat, memory, API keys, and settings are stored _locally_. No cloud sync, no account needed, and your data is yours.

- **Personalities & Personas:**  
  - **Vivica** is the always-on, never-deletable default persona:  
    > “Sharp wit, sultry charm, unapologetic presence, and a little dangerous.”
  - Add and edit your own profiles, each with their own model, prompt, and settings.

- **Multi-Model Support:**  
  - Choose your own AI model for each profile.
  - Assign a specialized coder model (like `qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct:free`) for programming questions, with seamless handoff to Vivica for human-style delivery.

- **Voice Mode (with Custom Animation):**
  - Beautiful orb animation for speech recognition and text-to-speech.
  - VoiceMode is responsive, visually dynamic, and designed to *feel* like a real companion—not just a boring mic button.
  - After Vivica speaks, listening automatically resumes so conversations flow naturally.

- **Memory System (Knowledge Base):**  
  - **Global memory**: persistent knowledge shared by all profiles.
  - **Profile-specific memory**: each persona can remember unique facts or stories.
  - Memories are summarized and saved with one click, can be edited or deleted, and are included as context in future chats.

- **Save & Summarize:**  
  - Click the bookmark icon to save a conversation summary and key facts to memory, with Vivica’s voice and style.

- **Reliable API Key Management:**  
  - Add up to three OpenRouter keys; Vivica automatically falls back to the next key on error or rate limit.
  - Brave Search API support for live web results—key is stored locally and never sent to a server.

- **Web Search Integration:**  
  - Use `/search your topic` in chat to fetch real-time results via Brave Search.
  - Vivica summarizes, analyzes, or jokes about search results in her own style.

- **Weather Widget:**  
  - Up-to-the-minute local weather in the sidebar/welcome screen.

- **Animated RSS News Ticker:**
  - Scrolls through the latest headlines from your chosen (or default ABC News) RSS feed.
  - Click a headline to inject it into chat—Vivica now fetches the full article via a CORS proxy,
    cleans it with the Readability algorithm, and then summarizes it with her usual flair.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA):**  
  - Installable on desktop and mobile.
  - Works offline, full data persistence, fast loading.

- **Modern UI & Theme System:**
  - Multiple color themes, dark/light toggle (with advanced dark themes for AMOLED screens).
  - Clean, focused layout designed for both desktop and mobile use.
- Floating "scroll to bottom" button appears when new messages arrive while you're reading earlier chat history.
- **Improved Code Blocks:**
  - Code snippets now have Prism-based syntax highlighting, a dark background, and a copy-to-clipboard button.
